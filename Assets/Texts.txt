<color=#868DE7>Hi dad! How you doing?
Busy as always. How about you?
<color=#868DE7>Fine, thanks
...
... ...
<color=#868DE7>Did you think about my offer?
Yes, and the answer is still no.
<color=#868DE7>... why?
<color=#868DE7>I can't understand you, dad.
<color=#868DE7>Why are you so stubborn?
I've been taking care of this old clock all my live and I'm not going to abandon it now.
<color=#868DE7>You are living in a ghost village, nobody cares if that old clock is still working.
<color=#868DE7>Come live with me, dad. You will be better here, in the town. We can ask a medic to check your leg and you will be here on your grandson's birthday.
<color=#868DE7>Isn't that a better plan than taking care of an old rusty clock that nobody is going to watch?
I'm sorry, son.
This clock is my life and I'm not going to abandon it.
I will keep it alive as long as I live.
<color=#868DE7>Dad...
I made a decision.
<color=#868DE7>OK, dad. As you want.
...
I love you son.
<color=#868DE7>Me too, dad. I'll call you tomorrow.
Bye.
<color=#868DE7>Goodbye.

...
It's time to take care of this old boy.
--CLOCK1
It's been 60 years now and this view still makes me feel alive.
It's in its last legs and is still so beautiful.
...
I must go to the machinary room. One day without cleaning and greasing it can be fatal.
--GEARS1
Don't worry, man. I will take care of your guts as if they were my own.
Even better, actually.
...
... ...
Seems perfect.
You will survive one more day.
...
It's so cold here, I must fuel the heater if I don't want to freeze this night.
--HEATER1
...
... ...
Much better.
As my father used to say.
Warm your house to warm your hearth.
...
He was a great man.
This tower is his legacy.
And It will die with me.
I'm probably the last person in the world who cares about it.
And I think it's fine.
We will die together.
...
It's late, I must get some rest. This leg is killing me slowly.

<color=#868DE7>Hi dad. How you doing?
My leg still hurts, otherwise I'm fine.
<color=#868DE7>Dad, you must go see a doctor.
I'm fine, honest.
<color=#868DE7>You are isolated there, got me worried dad...
I can take care of myself, son.
<color=#868DE7>As you want...
How is the child?
<color=#868DE7>He is fine, can't wait to see you. Yesterday, he drew you peeping out of your clock tower.
Hahaha, he will be a famous painter some day.
<color=#868DE7>Yeah, probably he will...
...
Can I speak to him?
<color=#868DE7>Sorry, he's at the school now. You can do it tomorrow, it's Saturday.
Oh, OK.
<color=#868DE7>Bye dad, take care of this leg.
I will. Bye, son. Love you.
<color=#868DE7>Bye.

...
OK, lets go to work. That machinary is not going to maintain on its own.
--GEARS2
...
... ...
Enough for today.
I love this sound. The clock's hearth.
So beautiful, so perfectly synchronized.
...
I must go fuel the heater. The winter is just around the corner. From now on, everyday will be colder.
--HEATER2
...
... ...
Done.
This place is now depressing. It bring me memories.
It's the warmest place in the tower. Still remember sitting here with my wife, drinking beer and having fun.
Good old times.
...
I must go bed, I'm really tired.
--WAKEUP3
My leg hurts so much.
Ugh

Hi son.
<color=#FF831C>Good morning! This is a lucky day for you! We are calling random numbers and gifting incredible prizes!
<color=#FF831C>You only have to answer a survey and wait your amazing gift.
Sorry, not interested.

...
Maybe he is busy today, I must go work.
It's really cold here, this damned heater must not be working.
I should check it first today.
--HEATER3
Hmm
Seems to be working just fine.
It's so strange. I'm so cold.
Anyways, I must go.
I have to maintain the clock machinary.
--HALLWAY3
Ugh
